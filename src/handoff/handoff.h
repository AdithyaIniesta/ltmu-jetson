/**
 * @file handoff.h
 * @brief Cross-view target handoff between boresight and depression cameras.
 *
 * Given stereo calibration (K_L, K_R, R, t) and a per-frame target depth
 * (constant indoor / barometer AGL on the airframe), this module computes
 * the pixel in one camera that corresponds to the tracked target pixel in
 * the other camera. Enables:
 *
 *   1. Symmetric handoff — target visible in either camera can be handed
 *      to the other automatically when it approaches the shared-FOV
 *      region, or when the receiving camera is currently LOST.
 *
 *   2. Dual-lock sanity check — both cameras track simultaneously; the
 *      module cross-projects each camera's rect to the other and flags
 *      drift or disagreement between them.
 *
 * Depth model: single ground plane at `plane_depth_mm` in the boresight
 * camera's optical-axis Z. Indoor: fixed value from run script prompt.
 * Airframe: replace with per-frame barometer AGL (separate change).
 *
 * Both directions are precomputed once at boot as 3x3 homographies:
 *   H_L2R : (u_L, v_L) → (u_R, v_R)
 *   H_R2L : (u_R, v_R) → (u_L, v_L)
 *
 * A single float multiply-add per pixel per direction — negligible cost
 * even at 60 fps on both cameras.
